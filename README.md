# Pseudo-Random-Number-Generators-PRNG

Project Highlights:                                                                                                                                               
1. Studied the evolution of PRNGs starting from the first PRNG in 1946 by John Von Neumann.                         
2. The main focus of the study was Middle-Square Weyl Sequence PRNG and the algorithm behind its working.
